# Pneumonia-Prediction
Description: Constructed a prediction model for early detection of Pneumonia using chest X-ray images. Techniques Used: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and further enhanced the model's accuracy using Transfer Learning techniques like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Outcome: Achieved an accuracy of 93.52%.
